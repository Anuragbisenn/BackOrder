# Problem Statement:
To predict BackOrder prdiction using Machine Learning.

# Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

# Project Various Step
## Data Exploration
I started exploring datasets using pandas, NumPy,matplotlib and seaborn.

## Data cleaning.
checking null values, checking outliers, checking imbalance in dataset.

## Data visualization
Ploted colleration matrix to get insights about dependend and independed variables.
making bar graphs, box plot, scatter plot, etc.

## Model Selection 
Made many Models(linear regression, svm, xgboost, Random Forest).
But selected RandomForest Regressor.

## Model Dump
As per selected trained model is dumped to pickled format for app development

## Ide used:
Pycharm

Using Flask for making UI.
Database = Casendra_database
